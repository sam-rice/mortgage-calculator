### Abstract

This project is a simple command line application that will calculate the payment schedule for a mortgage based on the user's input (principal, interest, loan duration).

### Project Context

This project was my entry for Turing School of Software & Engineering's Switch Tech Hackathon. My goal was to build a simple application in Java within about 3 hours. I started teaching myself Java recently, and decided to focus on utilizing proper object-oriented design (encapsulation, inheritance, abstraction, etc.) over impressive functionality.
